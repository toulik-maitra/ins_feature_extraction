# INS ML Analysis System - Technical Documentation

This document provides detailed technical information about the algorithms, methods, and implementation details of the INS ML Analysis System.

## 🔬 Core Algorithms

### Peak Detection Algorithm

The system uses SciPy's `find_peaks` function with optimized parameters for INS spectra:

```python
def detect_peaks_from_spectrum(self, prominence=0.005, distance=2, width=1, smooth_window=5):
    """
    Detect peaks using Savitzky-Golay smoothing and prominence-based detection.
    
    Parameters:
    - prominence: Minimum peak prominence (0.005 for experimental, 0.01 for simulated)
    - distance: Minimum distance between peaks (2-10 cm⁻¹)
    - width: Minimum peak width (1-5 cm⁻¹)
    - smooth_window: Savitzky-Golay smoothing window (5-15)
    """
```

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Smoothing**: Apply Savitzky-Golay filter to reduce noise
2. **Peak Detection**: Use prominence-based detection to find significant peaks
3. **Filtering**: Remove peaks outside energy range (0-3500 cm⁻¹)
4. **Validation**: Ensure minimum distance and width requirements

### Gaussian Peak Fitting

Each detected peak is fitted with a Gaussian function:

```python
def gaussian(x, amplitude, center, sigma):
    """
    Gaussian function: f(x) = amplitude * exp(-(x-center)²/(2*sigma²))
    
    Parameters:
    - amplitude: Peak height
    - center: Peak center position
    - sigma: Standard deviation (FWHM = 2.355 * sigma)
    """
    return amplitude * np.exp(-(x - center)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
```

**Fitting Process:**
1. **Initial Guess**: Use detected peak parameters as initial values
2. **Global Fitting**: Fit all peaks simultaneously using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`
3. **Constraints**: Apply physical constraints (positive amplitudes, reasonable widths)
4. **Quality Assessment**: Calculate R² and RMSE for fit quality

    """
